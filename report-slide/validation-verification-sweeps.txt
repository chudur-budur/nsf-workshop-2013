--- Validation, Verification and Sweep ---

Linkage btween mason and optimization 
-- in order to prove that your agent rules, as well as your model is
    accurate enough to be taken "seriously"

Parameter Sweep (why do we actually need it?)
-- Model validation
-- Model calibration
-- intersting areas of space
-- bugs and interesting behaviors
-- separation between model and parameter sweep
-- variation between, and specification of distributions/functions
-- e.g. rebeland - if we hadn't linked to ECJ we would have been shooting in the dark

Why such integration is interesting?
-- Jeff Bassett, workflow process for parameter sweep is also interesting 

To do:
-- dynamic parameter sweep, change parameter settings according to the model performance (on the fly)
-- wizard for parameter sweep process, for IDE development, -- could be important for the policy makers
-- parameter sweep needs to be more user-friendly for non-cs people
-- it makes it easier to a larger set of people to learn/understand what it means to parameterize a model, sweep parameters, or optimize parameters

Linkage between MASON and optimization package:
-- something like Apache Commons.Math
-- something like Abstract PDF (Prob. Density Func) in Apache?
-- ECJ needs to be more user friendly so that it could be usable to non-ec/non-cs people
-- Linkages of other optimization packages with ECJ, hooks, bridge code, etc. 
-- Something like GUROBI (http://www.gurobi.com) would also be very nice
-- helps transition from other optimization/parameter tools to MASON's - part of the validaiton goal

Why this issue is important?
-- just a piece of cake - claudio

how it would benefit us as:
-- data driven parameters, how to infer parameter distribution of a certain parameter, oil prediction 30 years out, looking for parameter distribution instead of parameter values. A model to get distribution of various oucomes based on useer defined distributions to search parameter space, e.g. oil prediction 30 years out, distributions of outcomes rather than just "what is best".
-- some models will be important for parameter sweep applications, like claudio's refugee camp model -- this will help to make MASON more relevant for serious real world application rather than toy lab experiments/academic/theoretical pursuit.
-- models need to be "realistic", not only for university education and research, solve real world problems? making money?
-- by providing some "gold standard" methods for parameter sweep/opt, verif/valid. helps modelers/users to do this work, espeicially if they don't already know how to do it.
