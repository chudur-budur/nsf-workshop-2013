-- Previously, had some problems with CUDA + MASON
-- CSC people mainly cares about theoretical aspects of social science.

Hybird models:
-- like D-MASON and CUDA

Issues:
-- Fish model, could be parallelized to some extent and will be important as well.
-- Need to show commonality of challenges in biological, ecological and social models how they could be benefited using parallel MASON framework.
-- Need to find out "computationally intensive agents", also considering scale (i.e. large number of agents).
-- Equation-solvers constantly running on GPU and pulled up by MASON agents time to time.
-- Rob Axetel wants to model entire country's economy down to individual human level.
-- Parallel parameter exploration in parallel, like MASON + ECJ + RebeLand.
-- Advancing this topic (i.e. parallelization) will benefit everybody in many ways.
-- Eliciting global and local actions of agents and need to understand how to distribute them.
-- Multiple partition of the space depending on the scale, e.g. duck models.
-- What if some portion of the model is not decomposable while they are sitting on decomposable space? e.g. RebeLand tax collection, space is decomposable but tax collection process is global.
-- Partition on the agent level, reduces to network structure, which should be very important for AITIA people. 
-- Network could be random, scale-free, dynamic or static -- will effect the distribution over multiple machines. This issue needs to be investigated.
-- Local agents communicate with remote agents to gather global information -- what happens when both type of communication models are mixed?
-- Small range interaction and large-global scale communication frequency may not be similar
-- Core categories -- Spatial, Network and Agent-level partitioning
-- How do parallel CFD (granular) models work? Is there any way to follow their approaches? (OpenFOAM?)
-- Besides load-balancing, fault tolerance is also important, needs to have good roll-back mechanism.
-- Check pointing, roll-back, snapshots etc needs to be implemented, we could steal some codes from Globus project. 
-- Simpler messaging communications like MQ?
-- How to adapt an already written serial model so that it could be made parallel with less amount of code modification?
-- What about dimension change? if your model is already in 2D, how would make it portable to parallel system in 3D, load balancing will be a nightmare.
-- How much research does involve in making a generic 2D load-balancing framework to a 3D one? little ??
-- Heterogenous hardware, how to inpsect partitions and allocations?
