o linkage btween mason and optimization 

  - in order to prove that your agent rules, as well as your model is
    accurate enough to be taken seriously

  - for policy makers

o model calibration
o model validation
o bugs and interesting behaviors
o separation between a model and a sweeper

o variation between, and specification of distributions/functions

o parameter sweep _package_ in MASON

  - parameter wizard?

  - it makes it easier to a larger set of people to learn/understand
    what it means to parameterize a model, sweep parameters, or
    optimize parameters

o linkage into other optimization packages, hooks, bridge code, etc.

  - helps transition from other optimization/parameter tools to MASON's
  - part of the validaiton goal

  - rebeland - if we hadn't linked to ECJ we would have been shooting in the dark

  - anecdote: a model with want to get distribution of various oucomes
  based on useer defined distributions to search parameter space,
  e.g. oil prediction 30 years ut, distributions of outcomes ratehr
  than just "what is best"

  - by providing some "gold standard" methods for parameter sweep/opt,
    verif/valid. helps modelers/users to do this work, espeicially if
    they don't already know how to do it.
